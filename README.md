## Key steps:

1.	Quality control (raw reads)
2.	Adapter trimming
3.	Alignment with Bowtie2
4.	Filtering, quality metrics
5.	Peak calling
6.	Downstream analysis: peak annotation + motif analysis
## Fragment size distribution  
 Periodicity pattern:  
	•	<100 bp = nucleosome-free fragments.  
	•	~180 bp = mononucleosome.  
	•	~350 bp = dinucleosome.  
  This ladder-like pattern indicates successful transposition and nucleosome positioning.
## Fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP)  
•	Proportion of aligned reads that fall within called peaks (accessible regions).  
•	Typical good ATAC-seq = >20% FRiP, excellent >30%.
